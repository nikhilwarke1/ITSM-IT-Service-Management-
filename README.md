# ITSM-IT-Service-Management-
An interactive ITSM analytics dashboard designed to track SLA compliance, ticket trends, resolution time, and CSAT, with forecasting to identify SLA risks and operational bottlenecks. Built to support data-driven decision-making for IT service management teams.


This project presents an interactive IT Service Management (ITSM) analytics dashboard designed to monitor, analyze, and forecast service performance using key operational metrics such as SLA compliance, ticket volume, resolution time, priority levels, and customer satisfaction (CSAT). The dashboard is built to support data-driven decision-making for IT operations and service delivery teams.

The solution visualizes end-to-end service desk performance by combining historical ticket data with analytical insights. It provides a clear overview of monthly SLA compliance trends, highlights priority-wise resolution behavior, and identifies drivers of SLA breaches across departments, categories, and support groups. A dedicated forecasting component projects future SLA performance, helping organizations anticipate risks and proactively improve service quality.

Key analytical views include:

SLA Compliance Trends & Forecasts to evaluate long-term performance stability

Resolution Time Analysis by Priority to detect operational bottlenecks

Ticket Volume & Category Distribution for workload assessment

Reopened Ticket Matrix to measure service quality and first-time resolution effectiveness

Executive KPIs such as Total Tickets, Average Resolution Time, SLA %, and CSAT

The dashboard is designed with a clean executive layout, making it suitable for both technical teams and management stakeholders. Interactive filtering enables deeper analysis across priority levels, departments, and issue categories, allowing users to quickly identify problem areas and improvement opportunities.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data analytics, visualization, ITSM domain understanding, and business intelligence storytelling. It reflects real-world service management scenarios and aligns with industry practices used in IT support and operations environments. The dashboard can be easily extended to integrate live service desk data, automated alerts, or predictive models for proactive incident management.

Overall, this project showcases the practical application of analytics in improving service efficiency, SLA adherence, and customer satisfaction within IT service management systems.
